Challenges:
Scaling and Automation: Implementing ECS Cluster Auto Scaling for PPE/DD/Rewards and automating AMI & Instance refresh solutions presented challenges in ensuring efficient resource usage and minimizing manual interventions.
Security and Compliance: Fixing and deploying PEN test vulnerabilities in production highlighted challenges in maintaining security compliance. Creating alarms for AWS services and Chef failures also required careful planning to prevent system issues.
Complex Deployment: Managing blue-green deployments for Node UI and Jenkins jobs involved overcoming challenges related to deployment reliability and reducing downtime during infrastructure changes.
Log Group Management: Updating the ECS deployment pipeline and deploying CFTs for handling CIDR ranges in ALB and VPC-links required meticulous configuration and testing.
Coordination of Multiple Releases: Managing end-to-end infrastructure releases in January and September, along with ad-hoc releases, required coordination, independent work, and balancing priorities effectively.
Speak Up:
Proactive Issue Resolution: The efforts in deploying infra alarms, PEN test fixes, and automating processes demonstrate a proactive approach to identifying and addressing potential issues early.
Ownership and Initiative: Taking ownership of critical deployments, log group creation, and bootstrapping domains, as well as documenting processes for blue-green node UI deployment, shows initiative and leadership in improving infrastructure management.
Cross-Team Collaboration: Handover of AWS infra alarms to other teams and coordinating releases reflect strong collaboration and communication across teams, fostering a culture of openness and shared responsibility.
